# Fall Detection System for Smartphone

This project aims to develop a fall detection system for smartphones. The system collects accelerometer and location data using a mobile application developed with Ionic framework. The collected data is then sent to an MQTT broker for further processing.

## Features

- Mobile application developed using Ionic framework for data collection.
- Integration with MQTT broker for data transmission.
- Python script for collecting, processing, and storing data from the MQTT broker.

## Requirements

- Ionic framework for mobile application development.
- MQTT broker for data transmission.
- Python with necessary packages for scripting and data processing.
